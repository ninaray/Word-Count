# Word Count
Practice in parsing and arrays.

Analyzes text files and prints out each word followed by the number of times 
it occurs in the file, without duplicates. This is done using Python.

Method is implemented on the command line through 
the command, "cat input* | python mapper.py | python reducer.py". The files inputfile1.txt
and inputfile2.txt are examples of parsable text.
